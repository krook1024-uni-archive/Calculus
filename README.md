# ðŸ”´ðŸ”µ Calculus

Two players play this game in which there are three stacks of
small rocks (hence the name; *Calculus*). The number of rocks in
a stack is the same for all three stacks. One round in this game
means both players taking an amount of rocks which can be between
one and a number defined at the start of the game. The winner is the
one taking the last rock.

This is a project of mine written for a class called

Network architectures and protocolls.
